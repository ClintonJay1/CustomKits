<ul>
<li>Autoload feature doesn't work</li>
<li>Some commands cannot be called from console</li>
<li>Issue with itemLimits & the <b>/giveslot</b> command: Every time its used, it will change the item limit on every other slot to whatever item limit is last used with the <b>/giveslot</b> command (For example: If I have 2 slots with an item limit of 30 and I use the command to get a additional slot with an item limit of only 15, the other 2 slots will now <i>also</i> have an item limit of 15...) </li>
